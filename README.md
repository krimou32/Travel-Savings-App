TRAVEL SAVINGS APP

You could do what this app does with a simple calculator but it was fun to build!

##-- How it works --##

1) User types in the travel's total cost in the first input.
2) User selects the departures date in the second input.
3) Daily savings needed to afford the travel are rendered in real time in the DOM.

@FUNCTIONS:

changeCost() : Updates the totalCost state in real time as the user types.
changeTimeLeft() : Updates the timeLeft state in real time every time the date is change in the second input.
updateDailySavings() : Calculates daily savings based on totalCost and timeLeft and updates the dailySavings state in real time.
